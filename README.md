==================

This project focuses on Python, R, and Maxima resources, references and tools for engineering and scientific computation. Special emphasis is on programming tools that include symbolic and algebraic computation.

The web pages have been generated from the XMind maps you can find at the companion project, [ReferencesAndResources] (https://github.com/jaimeglz/ReferencesAndResources). The use of mind maps for a references and resources knowledge base is still at an experimental stage.
